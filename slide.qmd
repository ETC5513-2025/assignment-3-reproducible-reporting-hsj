## Introduction

::: {.callout-note title="Graduate Employment in Australia (2023-2024)"}

According to [ABS](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/education/education-and-work-australia/latest-release) and [Ministers of the Education Portfolio](https://ministers.education.gov.au/clare/graduate-employment-rates-hit-highest-level-more-decade):

- **84%** of Australians with a `non-school qualification` in 2023 were employed in 2024.
- **78.5%** of `domestic graduates` and **57.7%** of `international graduates` found full-time job 4-6 months after graduation 
:::

:::{.fragment}
These high employment rates suggest that **academic grades alone may no longer be the key differentiator** in job outcomes.  
:::



:::{.callout-tip title = "Research Question" .fragment}
**What student behaviours, attributes, or practices are most associated with receiving more job offers?**

## Dataset Description 

::: {.callout-note title="Data Source"}
Kaggle - [Education and Career Success](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/education-and-career-success)  
:::

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width="65%"}

```{r}
data = read.csv("data/education_career_success.csv")
glimpse(data)
```
::: 

:::{.column width="35%"}

Dataset containing categorical, ordinal, and continuous variables.

- Demographic
- Academic Performance
- Skills and Experiences
- Career Outcome

The outcome, `Job_Offers`, is a counting variable

## Methodology

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

**Data Exploration**:

- Rows with `Gender = "Other"` (3.8%) are excluded due to small sample size  

**Variable Importance**:

- `Random forest` with `permutation`  
  - Handles mixed data types  
  - Captures non-linear relationships  

**Direction of Association**: 

- `Boxplot` and `scatterplot`
  - Suitable for count data  
  - Show group-wise patterns  

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r}
#| label: fig-genderDistribution
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Gender"
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-align: center

data %>%
  count(Gender) %>%
  mutate(
    perc = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1),
    label = paste0(Gender, ": ", perc, "%")
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  geom_text(aes(label = label), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), 
            fontface = "bold", 
            size = 5) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0)
  )
```
